# UI Developer

## MVP Work:
  ####  3, I accomplished this task by going above and beyond adding in animations to the webpage

## Team Contribution:
  ####  2, I accomplished this by matching the themes of my webpage to the theme of the React page. FE did not want help when offered for pair programming during zoom meeting.

## HTML/CSS:
  ####  3, I accomplished this by using LESS in deep knowledge

## Responsive:
  ####  3, I accomplished this by making the site responsive to desktop, mobile, and tablet devices

## JS Fundamentals:
  ####  3, I accomplished this by using a method inside of my accordion class constructor

## Applied JS:
  ####  3, I accomplished this by making a reusable accordion in the about page of my website that takes in an image, title, name, and      bio. With all components, the accordion successfully hides and shows the appropriate content at the appropriate time.

  ## OVERALL

  ### Home Page

  #### I believe I did well on this project. I created a nav button that drops down and added an animation to it(although it may be a tad too long, design that i've gone back and forth with). I then added a buttong to the top of the page tha tis only viewable in mobile and tablet. once in desktop, the button appears below the main text(also the anchor tag for the react app).

  #### I added reviews into the page, and also tussled with which animation to use on those as well. 

  ### About Page

  #### Same as the home page, the nav is animated as well. I added in here an accordion that opens and closes displaying photos of each team member, thier role in the project, a bio about thier part in the project, and a link to thier github account.
